This work tries to use LSTM to generate music. Due to the correlation of notes, LSTM is not a good candidates to generate music sequence.
Nevertheless, as a generative model, it could still produce some music.
This folder only includes the LSTM and its test code. 
Python MIDI package is used to process the mid file, which is not included here.  
The data files are are not included.
